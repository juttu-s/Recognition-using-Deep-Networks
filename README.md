# README - Project 5
Name - **SAIKIRAN JUTTU** & **KIRTI KSHIRSAGAR**

- Using Windows 10, VScode,OpenCV 4.9(recent one),Pytorch and python.
- Using 2 Time Travel Day (submitting on 3rd April 2024)

## This is a Readme file for Project-5 this includes all the details that are necessary to run the program.For this project, we have differnt files for different tasks.

### Task-1

### Task-2
- This task has been implemented in the **Task2.py** file.
- In this task, we examine our network and analyze how it processes the data.
    - Part A: In this task, we analyze the first layer and visualize the filters present in that layer.
    - Part B: In this sub-task, we show the effect of the filters on image from the dataset.

### Task-3

### Task-4

# Extension:
For the extensions, we have done the following tasks:
- Task 1 : This extension has been implemented in file called **Extension1.py**. For the first extension, we tried loading one pre-trained network (**ResNet18**) and evaluated its first couple of convolutional layers as we did in task 2.
- Task 2 : This extension has been implemented in file called **Extension2.py**. In this extension, we replaced the first layer of the MNIST network with **Gabor filters** and retrained the rest of the network, holding the first layer constant. We then compared the results from this and the original network.
- Task 3 :
